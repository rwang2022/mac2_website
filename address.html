                The Aging Research Group Laboratories is located on the <strong>Binghamton University
                    campus, in Science 4 Room 121.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you enter campus from the main entrance, use the first exit on the traffic circle to go right. Then,
                the parking lot for Science 4 will be the first left you come to. There is a designated space at the top
                of the lot (on the right, along the sidewalk) where you can park free of charge. Science 4 is the
                building immediately next to the parking lot (there are brains painted in the windows). We will meet you
                at the designated Psychology Department parking spot, located at the top of the lot.
